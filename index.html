    <h1>Website</h1>
    <h3>Welcome to my website</h3>
  </div>
  <p>The content of my website will also act as my tutorial.</p>
  <h3><a id="creating">Creating your website</a></h3>
  <p>To create a website you need to have content to fill the site with</p>
  <p>All websites are created in HTML which stands for hyper text markup language</p>
  <p>In order to create a HTML file use notepad but when you save it make sure you call it <span class="highlight">index.html</span> and save it as <span class="highlight">All files</span>.</p>
  <img src="https://image.ibb.co/dDYmhk/Save_as_html.png" alt="Save as html" border="0" />
  <p>When you try to open the file it should open your browser and your website should be displayed. Although it is in your internet browser, your website is not yet on the internet.</p>
  <p>If you want to edit your html code again, you have to right click it and select open with notepad.</p>
  <p>If you want to create CSS or Javascript to your website you have to do the same process but name them style.css and main.js respectively</p>
  <p>To connect your HTML with your CSS you have to add the code <span class="highlight">&ltlink href="/Website/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt</span> to the header part of your HTML</p>
  <p>To connect your HTML with your Javascript you have to add the code <span class="highlight">&ltscript src="/Website/main.js"&gt&ltscript&gt</span></p>
  <p>The src part of the Javascript link and href part of the CSS link must be replaced by the path to your own files.</p>
  <p>You can also add an image next to the title of the webpage known as a favicon by using similar code: <span class="highlight">&ltlink rel='shortcut icon' type='image/x-icon' href='/Website/favicon.ico' /&gt.</span></p>
  <p>Keep in mind that when you deploy your website you might have to change the file paths.</p>
  <h3><a id="images">Using your own images</a></h3>
  <p>In order to use your own images on your website you must upload your images to an image hosting site and use the url given to you in your html.</p>
  <h3><a id="deploying">Deploying your website</a></h3>
  <p>To deploy my website I used Github pages.</p>
  <p>In order to deploy a website with Github you must create an account then create a new repository to store your website information.</p>
  <img src="https://image.ibb.co/hPqGHk/new_repo.png" alt="new repo" border="0" />
  <p>You can select the option to initialize the repository with a README file, which you can delete later.</p>
  <img src="https://image.ibb.co/gipe3Q/README_part.png" alt="README part" border="0" />
  <p>OR</p>
  <p>You can use command prompt to create a Git repository for your website directory and connect that repository to the repository in Github like I did.</p>
  <p class="comment">Because the school prevents students from accessing command prompt, I had to use Codecademy's lesson to initialize my Git repository, which lets you access an instance of command prompt in their servers.(I think).</p>
  <img src="https://image.ibb.co/cd0MyQ/Initializing_github_repo.png" alt="Initializing github repo" border="0" />
  <p>Once you have done that you can create, upload, and edit files within Github.</p>
  <img src="https://image.ibb.co/ksQXNk/Brand_new_Repo.png" alt="Brand new Repo" border="0" />
  <p>In order to actually deploy your website to the internet go to settings and scroll down to the section called Github pages.<p>
  <p>From there set the source to the master branch and save.</p>

  <h3>Congratulations, your website should be up and running at the default domain given to you.<h3>
  <p>You can also change the domain but I have not learned how to yet.</p>
