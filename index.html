    <h1>Website</h1>
    <h3>Welcome to my website</h3>
  </div>
  <p>The content of my website will act as my tutorial.</p>
  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <p>To create a website you need to have content to fill the site with</p>
  <p>All websites are created in HTML which stands for hyper text markup language</p>
  <p>In order to create a HTML file use notepad but when you save it make sure you call it 
    <span class="highlight">index.html</span> and save it as <span class="highlight">All files</span>.</p>
  <img src="https://image.ibb.co/dDYmhk/Save_as_html.png" alt="Save as html" border="0" />
  <p>When you try to open the file it should open your browser and your website should be displayed. Although it is in your internet
    browser, your website is not yet on the internet.</p>
  <p>If you want to edit your html code again, you have to right click it and select open with notepad.</p>
  <p>If you want to add CSS or Javascript to your website you have to do the same process but name them 
    main.css and script.js respectively</p>
  <p>To connect your HTML, CSS, and Javascript you have to add the code shown in the picture below to your the header part of your
    HTML</p>
  <img src="https://image.ibb.co/bzBE2k/Linking.png" alt="Linking" border="0" />
  <p>The href part of the CSS link and the src part of the Javascript link must be replaced by the path to your own files.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that when you deploy your website you will have to change the file path.</p>
  <h3>Deploying your website</h3>
  <p>To deploy my website I used Github pages.</p>
  <p>In order to deploy a website with Github you must create an account then create a new repository to store your website 
    information.</p>
  <img src="https://image.ibb.co/bKUEJQ/New_repo.png" alt="New repository" border="0" />
  <p>Then you must use command prompt to create a Git repository for your website and connect that repository to the 
    repository in Github.</p>
  <p class="comment">Because the school prevents students from accessing command prompt, I had to use Codecademy's lesson to
    initialize my Git repository, which lets you access an instance of command prompt in their servers.(I think).</p>
  <img src="https://image.ibb.co/cd0MyQ/Initializing_github_repo.png" alt="Initializing github repo" border="0" />
  <p>Once you have done that you can create, upload, and edit files within Github.</p>
  <img src="https://image.ibb.co/ksQXNk/Brand_new_Repo.png" alt="Brand new Repo" border="0" />
  <p>In order to actually deploy your website to the internet go to settings and scroll down to the section called Github pages.<p>
  <p>From there set the source to the master branch and save.</p>
  <h2>Congratulations, your website sould be up and running at the default domain given to you.<h2>
